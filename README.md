# Mattermost Quality Assurance Community

### A place for like-minded quality assurance people to come together to help test Mattermost’s software

If you like breaking software, have a keen eye for UI-related bugs and want to help report your findings, here’s how you can join our testing community. You can find help and more information in the following places:

* Join our [Contributors server](https://community.mattermost.com/signup_user_complete/?id=codoy5s743rq5mk18i7u5ksz7e&sbr=sa)
* Join the [~QA: Contributors channel](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/qa-contributors) on the Contributors server
* [Forum post](https://forum.mattermost.org/t/help-test-mattermost-s-apps/10630)
* [Blog post](https://mattermost.com/blog/mattermost-launches-qa-contributor-program/)

### Here's how you can make an impact

#### Exploratory testing

This is where testers explore the software (can be on webapp, mobile apps, or desktop app) and give feedback on anything they think doesn’t make sense or is difficult to navigate or understand. You can download the desktop and mobile apps [here](https://mattermost.com/download/#mattermostApps).  

* Exploratory testing assignments can be located [here](https://github.com/mattermost/quality-assurance/issues/2).

#### Feature testing (ad-hoc)

Pre-production features, or features already in production are tested from a feature spec. 

* When feature testing assignments are available, they will be located [here](https://github.com/mattermost/quality-assurance/issues). 
* The GitHub issue will be clearly headed “Pre-production / Production Feature testing” and will include instructions and a spreadsheet for your feedback.

#### Release testing

We test the software on the release branch approximately 2 weeks before release (monthly on the 16th) so we can report any bugs. 

* When release testing assignments are available, they will be located [here](https://github.com/mattermost/quality-assurance/issues). 
* The GitHub issue will be clearly headed “Release testing” and will include instructions and a spreadsheet for your feedback.
